# 🌌 AsteroMiner AI 
**Identifying High-Value Asteroids for Space Mining Using Machine Learning**



## 🧠 Overview

**AsteroMiner AI** is an end-to-end ML-powered solution that identifies profitable asteroids for space mining. Developed for Smart India Hackathon 2024, it uses NASA’s Near-Earth Object (NEO) dataset (10L+ records) to:

- Classify asteroids as high- or low-value using machine learning  
- Visualize 3D asteroid parameters in real-time  
- Estimate mining revenue and recommend viable targets
